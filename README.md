# **Image Enhancement with OpenCV DNN**

This Mini Python code does some image super resolution using DNN in OpenCV. Trying out LapSRN and EDSR with Traditional methods just for the heck of it.
## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Uses OpenCV's DNN module for image enhancement
- Supports EDSR and LapSRN models
- Can upscale images up to 8x higher resolution
- Saves upscaled images for comparison
- Includes example usage and output images
## ðŸ“š Libraries Used
- OpenCV
- cv2
- dnn_superres
- CUDA for faster processing(Requires NVidia Graphics)
## ðŸ’» Usage
*The main steps are:*
- Initialize DNN super resolution object
- Read pre-trained enhancement model
- Set model type and upscale factor
- Read input image
- Upscale image with DNN
- Save upscaled image
- Compare with bicubic upscaling

**4x Upscaling with EDSR Method 2:**

*Added in REPO(File too large)*

**8x Upscaling with LapSRN:**

*Added in REPO(File too large)*
